# PiStorms

The [PiStorms](http://www.mindsensors.com/content/78-pistorms-lego-interface) is a robotics platform. It enables you to create robots using LEGO Mindstorms parts, and control it on a Raspberry Pi with Python. Besides its 4 motor ports, 4 sensor ports, and all the benefits of the Raspberry Pi, the PiStorms lets you do even more. It has a touchscreen for easy visual feedback and touch input. It has a convenient web interface to program and control the device, even accessible on mobile devices.

This document will introduce you to the repository's structure and how the PiStorms functions overall.


## Platform structure and systems

### The Browser
- MSBrowser is the program the end-user will use to launch Python programs on the PiStorms
- Each page displays four items (files and folders). Left and right arrows in the top corner allow for page navigation.
- Tapping a folder will open it, and the leftmost page will have an up arrow to close it and go back
- The hostname appears in cyan at the top, and a battery indicator is shown in the bottom-right
- An red exclamation mark icon will appear in the top-right if there is a new message or update available

### The Web Interface
- Accessing the PiStorms's hostname via a web browser will yield the [PiStorms Web Interface](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/how-to/how-to-access-pistorms-web-interface)
- The dashboard provides basic information including the software and firmware versions, Ethernet and WiFI IP addresses, and current battery voltage. Additionally there are buttons to shutdown or restart the Raspberry Pi, stop or start the browser, and begin touchscreen calibration.
- There is a tab to write and edit programs from your web browser. You can write Python or use the [Blockly](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/pistorms/visual-programming-for-pistorms-robots) visual programming interface here.
- Screenshots can be taken at any time. This page lets you start and stop recording screenshots, as well as download individual screenshots or clear them all.
- A remote control is available, which is particularly useful on a mobile device. There is a joystick to move your robot (using motors B and C). There are also sliders to set the LED colors.
- Log files are also accessible from the web interface

## Repository files

### setup
#### Suggestions
- When developing, run setup/enableHardlinks.sh to hard link the source files from `/home/pi/PiStorms/...` to their intended locations in the file system (where `setup.h` copies them). This will avoid, for instance, modifying `sys/MSBrowser.sh`, but forgetting to copy it to `/usr/local/bin/MSBrowser.sh` and wondering why your edits don't seem to be changing anything (still, don't forget to run `sudo /etc/init.d/MSBrowser.sh restart`!).

### sys

### README.md
- Instructions for an end-user to download and setup this project

### CONTRIBUTING.md
- An overview of this repository and explanation of the structure of this project

## Details
Lets walk through what setup.sh does from start to finish, and what happens at boot time. We will also cover every relevant directory on the system.

`MSDriver.sh`, `MSBrowser.sh`, and `MSWeb.sh` will run at boot time. MSDriver handles shutting down the system when GO is held.

The PiStorms has firmware which controls the motor and sensor ports, and which gets input from the touch part of the touchscreen. The Raspberry Pi sends commands over I2C to the PiStorms to tell it what to do. The screen itself communicates via SPI. This means that the screen might work, but you won't be able to tap anything because you can't get touchscreen values from the PiStorms if I2C is broken. The opposite is, therefore, true, too. The screen will not work if SPI is broken, but you could still move motors, etc. if I2C is still functioning.

## Design improvement suggestions
- There are a number of things I would like to better organize or clean up, but most would be difficult due to the requirement of supporting previous systems. Backwards compatibility is the issue.
- For example, the images MSBrowser relies on should not be cluttering up the general programs folder.
- `rmap.py` should be renamed to make its purpose (Scratch) more clear.
- `MsDevices.py` and `mindsensors.py` should be merged.
- The log files should have more meaningful names and be put in `/var/log`, not `/tmp`. Further, `.psm_shutdown.lck` should be in `/var/lock`, not `/tmp`. Note `/var/lock` *is* on a temporary file system, so a reboot will remove any stale locks.
